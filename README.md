# predicting_context
This is just to demonstrate the power of LSTMs . I just copied content from a wikipedia page and built a model that predicts the middle word 
based on the vicinity words given. Due to limited processing resources i had to limit the size of the training data.
for better results , do increase the data set size and no of training epochs. i managed to reduce the error from 145 to 137 in a few epochs and 
a small data set . Feel free to test and play with the code.
